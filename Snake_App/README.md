# Background
This program was made 100% percent by myself including the product design and the coding work. I made a completed APK so that you can install it on your phone. 

I made this APP due to an opportunity given by my first company-OPPO. In the first few months that I joined OPPO, It took me a lot of time to get familiar with the project. In order to help me warm up and strengthen my coding ability, my boss asked me to develop an app. So I made this interesting game app. It's not only a clone from the classic snake game but also carries some exciting innovations.
