# Background
This program was made 100% percent by myslef including the product design and the coding work. I made a completed APK so that you can install it on your phone. 

I made this APP due to an oppotunity given by my first company-OPPO. In the first few months that I joined OPPO, It took me a lot of time to get familiar with the project. In order to help me warm up and strenthen my coding ability, my boss ask me to develope an app. So I made this interesting game app. It's not only a clone from the classic snake game but also carries some exciting innovations.

# Main function description
